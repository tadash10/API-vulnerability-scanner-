# API-vulnerability-scanner-
Custom API Vulnerability Scanner: Build a custom vulnerability scanner tailored to detecting API-specific issues. This tool could:

 first Overview

The Custom API Vulnerability Scanner is a tool designed to identify security vulnerabilities in APIs. It includes checks for common vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection, XSS, and sensitive data exposure. It also integrates with Swagger/OpenAPI documentation for dynamic endpoint testing, and includes checks for token leakage and rate limiting. The tool can be used via a command-line interface (CLI) or a simple web-based UI.
Features

    Vulnerability Detection: Checks for SQL Injection, XSS, and sensitive data exposure.
    Token Leakage: Detects potential hard-coded or exposed tokens.
    Rate Limiting: Identifies rate-limiting mechanisms and thresholds.
    Swagger/OpenAPI Integration: Parses OpenAPI specifications to dynamically test endpoints.
    Web Interface: Provides a simple web-based UI for interaction (Flask-based).

Prerequisites

    Python 3.7 or higher
    requests library
    Flask library (for the web interface)
    pydantic library

Installation

    Clone the Repository:

    bash

git clone https://github.com/your-repo/api-vulnerability-scanner.git
cd api-vulnerability-scanner

Install Dependencies:

It is recommended to use a virtual environment.

bash

    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    pip install -r requirements.txt

CLI Usage
Basic Usage

The CLI allows you to scan an API by providing the URL of the OpenAPI specification.

    Run the Scanner:

    bash

    python scanner.py --url <API_DOCUMENTATION_URL>

    Replace <API_DOCUMENTATION_URL> with the URL of your OpenAPI specification.

Example

To scan an API with the OpenAPI documentation available at https://api.example.com/swagger.json, run:

bash

python scanner.py --url https://api.example.com/swagger.json

CLI Options

    --url: The URL of the OpenAPI documentation. This option is required.

Step-by-Step CLI Instructions

    Ensure Dependencies are Installed:

    Before running the scanner, make sure all required libraries are installed. Follow the Installation instructions.

    Prepare OpenAPI Documentation:

    Ensure that your API has an OpenAPI specification available at a publicly accessible URL.

    Run the Scanner:

    Execute the CLI command with the appropriate URL to start scanning:

    bash

    python scanner.py --url <YOUR_OPENAPI_SPEC_URL>

    Review Results:

    After the scan completes, review the output for identified vulnerabilities and issues.

Web Interface
Running the Web Interface

To use the web-based UI, start the Flask application:

bash

python web_interface.py

The web interface will be available at http://127.0.0.1:5000.
Using the Web Interface

    Open the Web Interface:

    Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000 in your web browser.

    Submit API Documentation URL:

    Enter the URL of the OpenAPI specification in the provided form.

    Start Scanning:

    Click the submit button to start the scan. The results will be displayed on the page.

Testing

To ensure the scanner functions correctly, run the test suite using pytest:

bash

pytest
